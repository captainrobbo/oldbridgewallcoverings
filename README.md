# oldbridgewallcoverings

This is the source for Ismet GraniÄ‡'s web site

The site will be hosted by GitHub Pages. 

The domain name is registered with GoDaddy (email: igramo@hotmail.com; username: oldbridge@wallcoverings), and will be pointed at the GitHub Pages.

We'll be building it with the (https://gohugo.io/)[Hugo] static site generator.

As much content as possible will be linked to Instagram, Facebook etc to avoid uploading hundreds of images

In the planning stage, we are making use of a shared (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1F49IMlM4IlXxi8oP6PCDiUsL2h6PIyJV)[Google Drive folder] to assemble images in.  Then Ismet can upload stuff on different time zones.
